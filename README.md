**thanks for using privchat**
? how do i get a custom gif background?
open index.html, download your gif and save it as something.gif (this can be anything but make sure its .gif or else the background might not work but who knows), and then go to line 18, and change the filename to whatever the name of your gif was. redo ```electron .``` and it should have restarted with the new gif!
!WARNING by default the gif background is rainbow colors, i suggest you change this is you suffer from things like epilepsy etc WARNING!
